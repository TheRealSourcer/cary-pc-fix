        <p>
            <strong>1. Service guarantee</strong><br />
            – 4‑Hour‑PC commits to complete an accepted repair job in <strong>four (4) hours</strong> of service time.<br />
            – We accept a job only after a technician confirms that the issue can be fixed within that window based on the details you provide.<br /><br />

            <strong>2. Refunds / Compensations</strong><br />
            – If a job we have accepted is <strong>not finished</strong> within 4 hrs, you will receive a <strong>full refund</strong> to the original payment method.<br />
            – If the technician stops before 4 hrs because the issue is <strong>unfixable</strong>, we will refund the proportion of time actually worked (e.g., 0.5 hr × hourly rate).<br />
            – We keep a log of start‑and‑end times; refunds are processed after confirming that the 4‑hr promise was exceeded or that the job was incomplete due to faultiness.<br /><br />

            <strong>3. Cancellation by Customer</strong><br />
            – Cancelling <strong>after acceptance but before work starts</strong> earns a full refund.<br />
            – Cancelling after work has begun may trigger a cancellation fee equal to the time the technician spent up to cancellation.<br /><br />

            <strong>4. What we’ll need from you</strong><br />
            – Clear communication (email, chat, phone) of symptoms, model, and diagnostics.<br />
            – If requested, a photo/video of obvious issues.<br />
            – Access to the computer (remote or onsite) as agreed.<br /><br />

            <strong>5. Limitations & Exceptions</strong><br />
            – We cannot guarantee a fix if the diagnostic is incomplete or if the hardware has been tampered with beyond what can be assessed.<br />
            – Third‑party software or data not related to the hardware failure will not be examined, and no compensation will be provided for related issues.<br />
            – Services performed outside the 4‑hr window (e.g., after‑hours, weekends) are subject to normal hourly rates and are outside this guarantee.<br /><br />
