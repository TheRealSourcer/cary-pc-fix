      <span class="font-bold">Refund Policy</span>
    </h2>

    <strong>1. Service Guarantee</strong>
    <p>
      – <span class="font-bold">4hourpc</span> commits to complete an accepted repair job in four
      (4) hours of service time.<br />
      – We accept a job only after a technician confirms that the issue can be fixed within that
      time window, based on the details you provide and our own assessment.
    </p>
    <br />

    <strong>2. Refunds / Compensations</strong>
    <p>
      – If a job we have accepted is not finished within 4 hours, you will receive a full refund to
      the original payment method.<br />
      – If the technician stops before 4 hours because the issue is unfixable, we will refund the
      proportion of time actually worked (e.g., 0.5 hr × hourly rate).<br />
      – We keep a log of start-and-end times; refunds are processed after confirming that the 4 hour
      promise was exceeded or that the job was incomplete due to faultiness.
    </p>
    <br />

    <strong>3. Cancellation by Customer</strong>
    <p>
      – Cancelling after acceptance but before work starts earns a full refund.<br />
      – Cancelling after work has begun may trigger a cancellation fee equal to the time the
      technician spent up to cancellation.
    </p>
    <br />

    <strong>4. What We’ll Need from You</strong>
    <p>
      – Clear communication (email, chat, phone) of symptoms, model, and diagnostics.<br />
      – If requested, a photo/video of obvious issues.<br />
      – Access to the computer (remote or onsite) as agreed.
    </p>
    <br />

    <strong>5. Limitations & Exceptions</strong>
    <p>
      – We cannot guarantee a fix if the diagnostic is incomplete or if the hardware has been
      tampered with beyond what can be assessed.<br />
      – Third-party software or data not related to the hardware failure will not be examined, and
      no compensation will be provided for related issues.<br />
      – Services performed outside the 4 hour window (e.g., after-hours, weekends) are subject to
      normal hourly rates for those times and are without the 4 hour guarantee.
    </p>
